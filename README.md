### Project description
In this project, an Auto Encoder (AE) and a Variational Auto Encoder (VAE) are designed in Python.

### Goals of the project
* Explore the gym framework for training RL agents.
* Apply my knowledge on VAE to learn image generation.
* Train generative models to produce sample pixel observation images from gym environments.

### Environment
[OpenAI's Gym](https://gym.openai.com/) is a framework for training reinforcement 
learning agents. It provides a set of environments and a
standardized interface for interacting with those.   
In this project, I used the [CartPole](https://gym.openai.com/envs/CartPole-v1/) environment from gym.

### Installation

#### Using conda (recommended)    
1. [Install Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual)

2. Create the env    
`conda create a1 python=3.8` 

3. Activate the env     
`conda activate a1`    

4. install torch ([steps from pytorch installation guide](https://pytorch.org/)):    
- if you don't have an nvidia gpu or don't want to bother with cuda installation:    
`conda install pytorch torchvision torchaudio cpuonly -c pytorch`    
  
- if you have an nvidia gpu and want to use it:    
[install cuda](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/index.html)   
install torch with cuda:   
`conda install pytorch torchvision torchaudio cudatoolkit=10.2 -c pytorch`

5. other dependencies   
`conda install -c conda-forge matplotlib gym opencv pyglet`

#### Using pip
`python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt`

### Code
[MyVAE.py](https://github.com/Ezgii/Variational-Autoencoder/blob/master/MyVAE.py) - my VAE model   
[train_vae.py](https://github.com/Ezgii/Variational-Autoencoder/blob/master/train_vae.py) - script to collect pixel observations from gym environments using a random policy, and train the VAE model     
[sample_vae.py](https://github.com/Ezgii/Variational-Autoencoder/blob/master/sample_vae.py) - samples from the VAE trained by train_vae.py    

### How to run the code
On terminal, write:

`python3 MyVae.py`

`python3 train_vae.py`

`python3 sample_vae.py`

### Results

Below figure shows two images generated by sampling from the Auto Encoder (AE). It can be seen that sampling from AEs may result in garbage images. This is because AEs have a non-regularized latent space. Their entire latent space does not have a generative capability. Hence, AEs are mainly used for compression.

Variational Autoencoders (VAE), on the other hand, provide the generative capability to the entire latent space. Below figure shows two images generated by sampling from the VAE.
